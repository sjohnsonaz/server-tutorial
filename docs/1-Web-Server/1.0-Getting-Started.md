For this tutorial, you will need several services.

1. Domain Hosting
2. Compute Hosting
3. Source Control Hosting
4. Continuous Integration/Deployment Hosting

This has been written with Google Domains, Microsoft Azure, and GitLab in mind, but it should be easily adapted to other services.

## Create Domain

At your Domain Hosting company, create a new Domain Name.

## Create Server

In your hosting company's control panel, create a new Server or Virtual Machine.  For this tutorial, we are specifically targeting **Ubuntu 16.4**, although it may apply to other versions as well.

This new Virtual Machine should come with a public IP address.  Copy that IP, and go back to your DNS Settings for your Domain.  Store it as the `@` record in the `A Names` section.

## Create Project Hosting

There is a large a variety of quality Source Control companies.  GitLab, GitHub, and BitBucket are all very solid solutions which provide free options.

However, for simplicity, GitLab provides free private repositories, as well as Continuous Integration Hosting.  Furthermore, if you are hosting your source at GitHub or BitBucket, GitLab with synchronize with those companies.  For this tutorial, we specifically target GitLab hosting.
